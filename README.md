This project explores how a honeypot can be used alongside a SIEM tool to better understand real world cyberattacks,it includes:-

-Deploying a Cowrie honeypot on Kali Linux to capture SSH and Telnet attacks.
-Integrating the honeypot with Splunk SIEM using HTTP Event Collector.
-Simulation of brute-force and Hydra attacks from an Ubuntu (WSL) machine.
-Analyzed 7 days of attack logs to study weak credentials and attacker behavior.
-Demonstrated how honeypot SIEM integration improves threat visibility and detection.
